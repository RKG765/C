        <h1>Conditional Instructions</h1>
        <p>Decision Making Instructions in C</p>
        <h3>If-Else statement</h3>
        <p>Code in the program. <br>Note:Else is not necessary but it is optional.</p> 
        <h4>Relational Opertors in C</h4>
        <p>Relational Opertors are used to evaluate conditions (true or false) inside the if statement. <br>Some Examples: <br>'==' means equals. <br>'>=' means greater than or equal to. <br>'>' means greater than.<br>'!=' means not equals to. <br>NOTE:'=' is used for assignment where as '==' is used for equality cheak. <br>The conditions can be any vald expression.In C a non-zero value is considered to be true.</p>
        <h4>Logical Operators</h4>
        <p>&&, ||, ! are three logical operators in C.These are read as "AND","OR","Not".They are used to provide logic to our C programs.As the number of conditions increases, the level of indentation increases.This reduces redablity logical operators come to rescue in such cases.</p>
        <h4>Else if clause</h4>
        <p>Instead of using multiple if statements, we can also use elseif along with if thus forming an if-elseif-else ladder. <br>Operator precedense: <br>1st---- ! <br>2nd---- *,/,% <br>3rd---- +,- <br>4th---- greaterthan,lessthan,greaterthan=,lessthan= <br>5th---- ==,!= <br>6th---- && <br>7th---- || <br>8th---- = <br>Conditional operators:It is a  short-hand "if-else". ----code in program name:03conditionalop.</p>
        <h3>Switch statement</h3>
        <h4>Switch-Case Control instruction</h4>
        <p>Switch-case is used when we have to make a choice between number of alternatives for a given variable. <br>Code in programname- 04switch.c/04quiz.c(fail).</p>
        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>1.What will be the output of this program.Code in program-- 05pr_set.c.<br> <br>2.Write a program to find out whether a student is pass or fail;If it requires total 40% and atleast 33% in each subject to pass.Assume 3 subjects and take marks as input from the user.<br> <br>3.Calculate the income tax paid by an employee to the government as per slabs mentioned below. <br>----> 2.5L to 5.0L is 5%. <br>----> 5.0L to 10.0L is 20%. <br>----> Above 10.0L is 30%.<br>NOTE: There is no tax below 2.5L.Take the input from the user. <br> <br>4.Write a program to find out weather a year entered by the user is leap year or not.Take year as an input from the user. <br> <br>5.Write a program to determine whether a character entered by the user is  uppercase or not. <br>NOTE:Use ASCII values form internet. <br> <br>6.Write a program to find the greatest of four numbers entered by the user.</p>
