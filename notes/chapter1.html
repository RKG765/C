        <h1>CH.1 Introduction</h1>
        <h2>What is Programming?</h2>
        <p>Computer programming a medium for us to communicate with computers.It is a way for us to deliver our instructions to the  computer. </p>
        <h2>What is C?</h2>
        <p>C is a programming language. <br> It is one of the oldest and finest programming language. <br>It was developed by Dennis Ritchie at AT & T's Bell labs, USA in 1972.</p>
        <h3>Uses of C</h3>
        <p>It is used to program wide variety of systems. <br>Some of the uses of C are as follows: <br>1.Major parts of windows, linux and other operating systems are written in C. <br>2.It is used to write drivers programs for devices like Tablets,Printers,etc. <br>3.It is used to program  embedded systems where programs need to run faster inn limited memory(Microwave,Cameras,etc.)</p>
        <h1>Variables,Constant&Keywords</h1>
        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>A variable is a container which stores a 'value'.It's value can be changed.<br>Such as:<br>a=3; (where a is assigned to 3.)<br> b='Rich';</p>
        <h3>Rules for naming variables in C</h3>
        <p>1.First character must be an alphabet or underscore(_).Like: int tom; & int _tom;<br>2.No commas(,),blanks allowed.Like: int to m; & int to,m.<br>3.No special symbol other than (_) allowed.Like: int %tom; & int tom&;<br>4.Variable names are case-sensitive.Means lowercase and uppercase matters.Like: int tom; & int Tom and soon.<br>You should make variable names neat and clean.</p>
        <h2>Constant</h2>
        <p>An entity whose value doen't change is called a constant.</p>
        <h3>Types of Constant</h3>
        <p>Integer constant:They are real number.Like: 1,-234,3442,etc. <br>Real constant:These are decimal number.Like:2.0,123.23,234.53,etc. <br>Character constant: These are for character.Like: 'a','@','&','$','etc.'NOTE: If you want to make Character constant then use it within the ''.</p>
        <h2>Keywords</h2>
        <p>There are reserved words, whose meaning is already known to the compiler.There are 32 Keywords available in C. <br>1.auto 2.double 3.int 4.struct 5.break 6.long 7.else 8.switch 9.case 10.return 11.enum 12.typedef 13.register 14.char 15.extern 16.union 17.const 18.short 19.float 20.unnsigned 21.continue 22.signed 23.for 24.void 25.default 26.sizeof 27.goto 28.volatile 29.do 30.static 31.if 32.while<br></p>
        <h1>Basic Structure of a C program</h1>
        <p>All C programs have to follow a basic structure. <br> A C program starts with a main function and execute intruction present inside it.Each instruction is terminated with semicolon(;).</p>
        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>There are some rules which are applicable to all C programs. <br>Every program's execution starts form main() function. <br>All statements are terminated with semi-colon. <br>Instruction are case-sensitive. <br>Instructions are executed in the same order in which they are written.</p>
        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <p>Comments are used to clarify something about the program in plain language It is a way for us to add notes to our program language. <br>Single-Line comment: //This is a comment. <br>Multi-Line comment: /* This is comment.*/. <br>Comments are not executed and ignored in C Language programs.</p>
        <h1>Compilation and Execution</h1>
        <p>A compiler is a computer program which converts a C program into machine language so that it can be easily understood by the computer. <br>A C program is written in plain text. <br>This plain text is compilation of instruction in a particular sequence.The compiler performs some basic checks and finally converts the program in to executable.</p>
        <h1>Library Functions</h1>
        <p>C Language has a lot of valuable library functions which is used to carry out certain tasks for instance printf function is used to print values on the screen.Such as: <br>printf("This is %d",i); <br> %d is for integers. <br>%f for realvalues. <br>%c for characters.</p>
        <h1>Types of Variables</h1>
        <p>1.Integer variable: int a=3; <br>2.Real variable: int a=8.1; float a=8.1;NOTE: Here the first code is wrong because you can't  assing a real constant into a integer. <br>3.Character variables: char a='R';</p>
        <h1>Recieving input from user</h1>
        <p>In order to take input from the user and assing it to a variable, we use scanf function. <br> syntax for using scanf function: <br>scanf("%d",&i); <br>Here & is the 'address of' operator and it means that the supplied value should be copied to the address which is indicated by the variable i.</p>
        <h2>Some Questions</h2>
        <p>1.Write a program to find the area of rectangle in the following ways: <br>i.By hard-coded method <br> ii.By user's input. <br>2. Write a program to calculate the area of circle and modify the same program to calculate the volume of cylinder given it's radius and height. <br>3.Write a program to convert a centigrate degrees temperature to  farenheit. <br> 4.Write a program to calculate simple intrest for a set of values representing principle, number of years, and rate of intrest.</p>
