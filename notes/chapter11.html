        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>C is a language with some fixed rules of programming.Such as:Changing the size of an array is not allowed/.</p>
        <h1>Dynamic Memory Allocation(DMA)</h1>
        <p>It is a way to allocate memory to a data structure during the runtime.We can use DMA functions avaliable in C to allocate and free the memory during the runtime.</p>
        <h2>Functions For DMA In C</h2>
        <p>Following functions are avaliable in C to perform the Dynamic Memory Allocation.</p>
        <h3>malloc() function</h3>
        <p>malloc stands for memory allocation.It takes number of bytes to be allocated as an input and returns a pointer of type void.</p>
        <h3>calloc() function</h3>
        <p>calloc function stands for continious allocation. <br>It initilizes each memory block with a defalult value of 0. <br>If the space is not sufficient memory allocation fails and a NULL pointer is returned.</p>
        <h3>free() function</h3>
        <p>We can use free() function to deallocate the memory. <br>The memory allocated using calloc/malloc is not deallocated automatically.</p>
        <h3>realloc() function</h3>
        <p>Sometimes the dynamically allocated memory is insufficient or more than required. <br>realloc() is used to allocate memory of new size using the previous pointer and size.</p>
