        <h1>Arrays</h1>
        <p>An array is a collection of similar elements. <br>Syntax: <br>int marks[90,123,1223]; ----> Integer Array<br>char name[]; ----> Character Array or String. <br>float percentile[90]; ----> Float Array. <br>NOTE: The array index starts with 0 to (n-1) where n is number which you assigned for making array. <br>Accessing Elements: <br>scanf("%d"),&marks[0]; ----> Input first value. <br>printf("%d",marks[0]); <br>Quick-Quiz: <br>1. Write a program to accept marks of five students in an array and print them to the screen. <br>Initialigation of an Array: <br>There are many ways inwhich an array can be initialised.</p>
        <h3>Arrays In Memory</h3>
        <p>It depends uponn which type of machine you are using. <br>Here we will a integer is equals to 4-byte. <br>Let's take an example: <br>int arr[3] ={1,2,3}; ---->This will reserve 12-bytes in memory. <br>If the address of int arr[3]; is 62000. Then it will reserve 62000 to 62008 for 1,2,3 as values. <br>NOTE: <br>Arrays address are continous.</p>
        <h2>Pointer Arithmetic</h2>
        <p>A Pointer can be incremented to point to the next memory location of that type. <br>If you do one time increment in int,float it will add 4-bytes to the address and you can add so on.In char it will 1-byte for capital and small letters. <br>Following operations can be performed on pointers in arrays. <br>1.Addition of a number to a pointer. <br>2.Subtraction of a number from a pointer. <br>3.Subtraction of one pointer from another. <br>4.Comparision of two pointer variables. <br> <br>Quick-Quiz: <br>Try these operations on another variables by creating pointers in a seperate program.Demonstrate all the 4 opertaions. </p>
        <h3>Pasing Arrays To Function</h3>
        <p>Arrays can be passed to the function like code in the program.</p>
        <h2>Multidimensional Arrays</h2>
        <p>An array can be of 2-dimensional/3-demensional/n-demensional. <br>2-d array code is in program. <br>In arrays with function you can also change the value in main within the another function. <br>You can access the array of 2-d by [0][0]; means 0th raw and 0th coloum.</p>
        <h3>Quick-Quiz</h3>
        <p>Create a 2-d array by taking input from the user.Write a display function to print the content of the 2-d array on the screen.</p>
        <h2>2-D Arrays In Memory</h2>
        <p>A 2-d array is stored like a 1-d array in continiuos memory blocks like this. <br> Like: ([0][0],[0][1]......</p>
        <h2>Practice Set</h2>
        <p>1.Create an array of 10 numbers.Verify using pointer arithmetic that (ptr+2) points to the third element, Where ptr is pointer pointing to the first element of the array.</p>
